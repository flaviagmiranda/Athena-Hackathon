Our project helps you become a better person

- click the button below that to be a better person and it will ask you to select if you're at home or at the office. for the demo, we're all definitely not in the office so we skipped that part for ease 
-API generates random and easy daily tasks for you to do whilst at home to be a better person 
-complete the task. be a better person, 1 day at a time
